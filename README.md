**Eazy Sound Manager** is a simple **Unity3D tool** which aims to make sound and music management in games easier. Playing a single audio clip is now as easy as calling one API function. The API can handle multiple music, game and UI sound effects at the same time while still giving you the option to interrupt previous audio clips when needed. Audio clips can be one shot, or looping.

Moreover, Eazy Sound Manager has the option to make music persist through multiple scenes, as well as add fade in/out transitions. Different global settings for music, game sound effects and UI sound effects are also implemented. However, each audio has its own volume setting which is always relative to its global volume.
